<!-- M x,y moveto Moves pen to specified point x,y without drawing.
m x,y moveto Moves pen to specified point x,y relative to current pen location,
without drawing.
L x,y lineto Draws a line from current pen location to specified point x,y .
l x,y lineto Draws a line from current pen location to specified point x,y relative
to current pen location.
H x horizontal
lineto Draws a horizontal line to the point defined by
(specified x, pens current y).
horizontal
lineto Draws a horizontal line to the point defined by
(pens current x + specified x, pens current y). The x is relative to the
current pens x position.
x
h
V y vertical lineto Draws a vertical line to the point defined by
(pens current x, specified y).
v y vertical lineto Draws a vertical line to the point defined by
(pens current x, pens current y + specified y). The y is relative to the
pens current y-position.
C x1,y1
x2,y2 x,y curveto Draws a cubic Bezier curve from current pen point to x,y. x1,y1 and
x2,y2 are start and end control points of the curve, controlling how
it bends.
c x1,y1
x2,y2 x,y curveto Same as C, but interprets coordinates relative to current pen point.
S x2,y2 x,y shorthand /
smooth
curveto Draws a cubic Bezier curve from current pen point to x,y. x2,y2 is
the end control point. The start control point is is assumed to be the
same as the end control point of the previous curve.
s x2,y2 x,y shorthand /
smooth
curveto Same as S, but interprets coordinates relative to current pen point.12
Q x1,y1 x,y quadratic
Draws a quadratic Bezier curve from current pen point to x,y. x1,y1
Bezier curveto is the control point controlling how the curve bends.
q x1,y1 x,y quadratic
Same as Q, but interprets coordinates relative to current pen point.
Bezier curveto
T x,y shorthand /
Draws a quadratic Bezier curve from current pen point to x,y. The
smooth
control point is assumed to be the same as the last control point

x,y Draws an elliptical arc from the current point to the point x,y. rx and
ry are the elliptical radius in x and y direction.
The x-rotation determines how much the arc is to be rotated around
the x-axis. It only seems to have an effect when rx and ry have
different values.
The large-arc-flag doesn't seem to be used (can be either 0 or 1).
Neither value (0 or 1) changes the arc.
The sweep-flag determines the direction to draw the arc in.
